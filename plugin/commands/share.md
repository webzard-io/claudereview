# Share Session

Share this Claude Code session to claudereview.com and give me a shareable link.

Find the current session file in ~/.claude/projects/, encrypt it, upload it to the claudereview.com API, and return the shareable URL.

The link should be end-to-end encrypted so only people with the link can view it.
